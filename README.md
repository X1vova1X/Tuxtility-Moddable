# Tuxtility Moddable

Tuxtility Moddable is a base for development flavors of Tuxtility.

## Flavors

Tuxtility flavors are forks of Tuxtility where they have more  (or less) features than Tuxtility!

For a fork of Tuxtility to be considered a offical flavor it must follow these terms

- It must have new features, it can't just be a recolor or name.
- You must include credit to Tuxtility, all of it's contributers (from the version it is based on) and the licence.
- Must have a different extension id to prevent conflics.
- Must **NOT** contain any malicious code. (If it does you will be banned from the discord server)
- It must not interfere with the website/page as it is against many sites rules (eg, PenguinMod)
- Must respect Scratch mod's (eg, PenguinMod) permission manager and TPM.
- Must be based on a stable version of Tuxtility.

If all of these terms are met, you may submit a ticket on the discord server to become an official Tuxtility flavor.

## TPM

Tuxtility Permission Manager (TPM) adds features where a user can prevent the extension from showing information about possibly dangerous things, like their, OS, Browser, Browser Language and Javascript code execution.

This is added so people can't take information about others computers with out consent.
